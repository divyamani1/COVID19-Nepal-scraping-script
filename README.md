# COVID19-Nepal-scraping-script
This repository contains the script to scrap Nepal's data of COVID19 from the [COVID19 data repository at John Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) to my personal repository.

The scraper scraps the repository twice a day and extracts data related to Nepal from the daily reports. The scraped data is stored at [COVID19-Nepal](https://github.com/divyamani1/COVID19-Nepal).
